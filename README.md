## Workflow

### GitHub Flow

https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/
branches:

- master
- dev branches

Start every dev branch off master and it a (long) descriptive name.

With collaborators only merge branches on GitHub (pull requests). When working by myself: I'm going to merge locally into master :P

## Deployment

### for now

What is on the pi, is what's currently deployed!

### Thoughts

- aliases point to the deployment directory.
- what about classes: They are all in the Python Path?!!!!
